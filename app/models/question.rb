class Question < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy # :nullify
    #  The popualr options are :destroy and :nullify. if you have answers associated with a question and you delete the question
    #  this will happen:
    #  :destroy option: it will delete all the answers whose question_id is the id of the question you deleted
    #  :nullify option :it will keep all the answer whose question is the id of deleted question and place null as question_id


    #GENERATING THIS FILE:
    #rails g model question title:string body:text
    #This above command creates this model Class in file question.rb
    #and also a migration file to create a table questions
    # 1. rails is console keyword that we use (instead of node, npm, knex, or ruby as we used before)
    # 2. g - stands for "generate"
    # 3. model - keyword to generate a model
    # 4. question is the name for our model - models are always singular
    # 5. title is the name of a property the model has with the type of string
    # 6. body is another property with the type of text
    # *This generates the class model and a migration file, similar to knex, that is not migrated yet


    #NAMING CONVENTIONS: A model is always singular and database tables are always plural
    #The Question Class is created and it inherits from the Application (ApplicationRecord)
    #Which in turn inherits from the Active Record library (see) application_record.rb

    after_initialize :set_defaults
    #this callback is executed after you have q = Question.create(....setting attributes...)
    #if you give a value for the specific attribute, it will be set to that value, otherwise
    #this method will set the value to the default value

    before_save :capitalize_title
    #q = Question.create(title:"hello", body:"World", view_count:2)
    #before_save will turn title into "Hello" before saving into the database
    
    
    #VALIDATIONS
    # validates :title, presence: true
    # Create validations by using the 'validates' method
    # The arguments are (in order):
    # - A column name as a symbol 
    # - Named arguments, corresponding to the validation rules
    
    validates :title, presence: {message: "not there!"}
    #passing a default message
    #alternative for passing a message would be to use .errors.full_messages in console

    #This scope would validate that the title is unique for that specific combination of body and title
    #This means that title doesn't need to be unique by itself and body doesn't 
    #need to be unique by itself, but its combination needs to be unique
    validates :title, uniqueness: {scope: :body}

    validates :title, length: { minimum: 2, maximum: 50}

    validates :view_count, numericality: {greater_than_or_equal_to: 0}

    #Custom validations are written in singular form
    validate :no_monkey

    #SCOPE with lambda
    # Scopes are such a commonly used feature, that
    # there's another way to create them quicker. It 
    # takes a name and a lambda as a callback
    #This can also be created by private method below
    scope :recent_ten, lambda{ order("created_at DESC").limit(10)}

    # EXERCISE: Searching Questions
    #Implements a search method to do a wildcard search on both title and body

    # def self.search(query)
    #     where("title ILIKE ? OR body ILIKE ?", "%#{query}%", "%#{query}%")
    # end

    # Equivalent to:
    scope(:search, -> (query){ where("title ILIKE ? OR body ILIKE ?", "%#{query}%", "%#{query}%") })
    def self.all_with_answer_counts
        self.left_outer_joins(:answers)

        # like the . operator to call methods on an object.
        # If the method doesn't exist for the object, 'nil'
        # will be returned instead of getting an error
            self.errors.add(:body, "must not have monkeys")
            # To make a record invalid. You must add a 
            # validation error using the 'errors' 'add' method
            # It's arguments (in order):
            # - A symbol for the invalid column
            # - An error message as a string

# A C T I V E    R E C O R D 
    # Fetch All Questions
    # questions = Question.all ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back the list of questions as an object
    # the object behaves like an array so you can call methods on it like (.each) and you
    # can also chain it with other methods to do other types of operations and queries

    # Creating a new question
    # To create a new question object in memory do:
    # q = Question.new
    # you can also pass in a hash to the new method as in:
    # q = Question.new({ title: 'To be or not to be', body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 })
    # or for short:
    # q = Question.new title: 'To be or not to be }, body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 

    # to save the above question into questions table:
    # q.save ðŸ‘ˆ this will save that above question into the questions table (persist it)

    # Creating a record right away
    # you can create a record right away in the database using (.create) method as in:
    # Question.create({ title: 'My Question Title', body: 'My question body', view_count: 1 })

    # Fetching Records
    # .first
    # Question.first ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the first record ordered by the id in an ascending order
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "questions"."id" ASC LIMIT 1;

    # .last
    # Question.last ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the last record ordered by the id in an ascending order 
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "qeustions"."id" DESC LIMIT 1;

    # .find
    # Question.find(1) ðŸ‘ˆ finding records by their primary key which is likely id

    # .find_by_x ðŸ‘ˆ x is the column name
    # Question.find_by_title('My Last Question') ðŸ‘ˆ this finds a question with title 
    # exactly "My Last Question"

    # .where
    # Question.where({ title: 'My Last Question', body: 'The body of the question' })

    # WILDCARD SEARCHING 
    # You can perform  wildcard searching with ActiveRecord using LIKE within "where" method
    # Question.where(['title LIKE ?', '%Last%'])
    # if you are using Postgres client, you can use ILIKE for case-insensitive searching:
    # Question.where(['title ILIKE ?', '%Last%'])
    # Note that in above queries we used a syntax that used '?' to insert variable into a SQL query.
    # this is important to avoid SQL injection if the variable component is actually a user input such
    # as search term.

    # .limit
    # Question.limit(10) ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back 10 first questions that are returned from the query

    # .order
    # Question.order(:created_at) ðŸ‘ˆ this will order the fetched records by created_at. by default is ASC and 
    # if you want them in descending order do:
    # Question.order(created_at: :DESC)


    # Chaining
    # You can chain the wher, limit, order, offset, and many others to compose
    # more sophisticated queries for example:
    # Question.where(['view_count > ?', 10]).where(['title ILIKE ?', 'a']).order(id: :DESC).limit(10).offset(10)
    # Note: offset will skip first 10 records from the above query
    # SQL equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" WHERE (view_count > 10) AND (title ILIKE 'a') ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10
    # another example:
    # Question.where(['view_count < ?', 10]).where(['body ILIKE ?', '%question%']).order(id: :DESC).limit(1).offset(1)

    # UPDATE RECORDS
    # once you've selected one or more records, you have ability to update them
    # Many setting attributes:
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.title = "Some new title"
    # q.save
    # q.view_count += 1
    # q.save

    # using .update_attributes or .update
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.update({ title: 'Updated Title', body: 'Updated body' }) or
    # q.update_attribute(:title, 'Updated Title') or
    # q.update_attributes(title: 'Updated Title', body: 'Updated body')

    # DELETING RECORDS
    # using .destroy
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.destroy

    # using .delete
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.delete

    # using .delete skips executing callback methods after_destroy and before_destroy 
    # and also skips deleting or nullifying associated records in the :dependant option
    # with associtations. Generally, avoid using ".delete" in favor of ".destroy". there are
    # only few cases when you want to use ".delete"

    # Aggregate functions
    # .count
    # Question.count ðŸ‘ˆ counts the number of records in questions model
    # SQL equivalent:
    # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "questions";

    # .groud
    # Question.select('avg(view_count)) as count').group('title')

    # CALLING RAW QUERIES
    # connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
    # result = connection.execute('SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id=1;')
    # result.first ðŸ‘ˆ because the result is an array of hashes
